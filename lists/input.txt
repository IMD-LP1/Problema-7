List
Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions. 
List containers are implemented as doubly-linked lists; Doubly linked lists can store each of the elements they contain in different and unrelated storage locations. The ondering is kept internally by the association to each element of a link to the element preceding it and a link to the element following it.
